* Algorithms
  There are 4 solvers : =Base=, =MADEC=, =RDS=, =CPLEX=. You could call any of them using =-a= option.
  Note that =Base= and =MADEC= all implement *MADEC+* which has been described in the paper.
  - =Base= is the first version of implementation, which allows us to control its behavior explictly. e.g. We could use =--noDiam= or =--noColor= when we are using this implementation. This version is more readable. If you want to use *MADEC* instead of *MADEC+*, you could use this implementation and add =--noDiam= =--noColor=.
  - =MADEC= is a re-implementation of the "Base", which optimizes the running time, but removes all the customizable parts.

* Steps for Deployment
 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 cmake .
 make && make install
 #+END_SRC

 If you want to compile with the IP solver (CPLEX), you could first set the location of CPLEX in =CMakeLists.txt=, then type:
 #+BEGIN_SRC bash
 cmake -DIP_SOLVER=ON .
 make && make install
 #+END_SRC
 
 And then you will get the executable file at =./Debug/=
